# DSA_Problems_PYTHON

This repository contains Python implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) commonly used in technical interviews and competitive programming. Each solution is well-documented with clear explanations, making it easier for users to understand the logic and approach behind the implementation.

The goal of this repository is to help Python learners and coding enthusiasts understand how to solve common DSA problems using Python.

Data Structures Covered
* Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked Lists)
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
* Hash Tables (Dictionaries in Python)
* Graphs
